1. Welcome

    Welcome to Embedded Linux TPM Toolbox 2 (ELTT2).
    ELTT2 is a single-file executable program intended for testing, performing
    diagnosis and basic state changes of the Infineon Technologies TPM 2.0.


1.1 Prerequisites

    To build and run ELTT2 you need GCC and a Linux system capable of hosting a
    TPM 2.0.

    Tested PC Platforms (x86):
      - Ubuntu (R) Linux 12.04 LTS - 64 bit (modified Kernel 3.15.4)
        with Infineon TPM 2.0 SLB9665 Firmware 5.22

    Tested Embedded Platforms (ARM):
      - Android 6.0 "Marshmallow" - 64 bit (modified Kernel 3.18.0+) on HiKey
        with Prototype Infineon I2C TPM 2.0 for Embedded Platforms

    ELTT2 may run on many other little-endian hardware and software
    configurations capable of running Linux and hosting a TPM 2.0, but this has
    not been tested.

    ELTT2 does not support machines with a big-endian CPU.


1.2 Contents of Package

    ELTT2 consists of the following files:
    - eltt2.c
      Contains all method implementations of ELTT2.
    - eltt2.h
      Contains all constant definitions, method and command byte declarations
      for the operation of ELTT2.
    - License.txt
      Contains the license agreement for ELTT2.
    - Makefile
      Contains the command to compile ELTT2.
    - README.txt
      This file.


1.3 Getting Started

    In order to execute ELTT2, you need to compile it first:
      1. Switch to the directory with the ELTT2 source code
      2. Compile the source code by typing the following command:
         make

    Due to hardware (and thus TPM) access restrictions for normal users, ELTT2
    requires root (aka superuser or administrator) privileges. They can be
    obtained e.g. by using the 'sudo' command on Debian Linux derivates.


2. Usage of ELTT2


2.1 Generic Usage

    ELTT2 is operated as follows:

    Call: ./eltt2 <option(s)>

    For example: ./eltt2 -g or ./eltt2 -gc

    For getting an overview of the possible commands, run ./eltt2 -h

    Some options require the TPM to be in a specific state. This state is shown
    in brackets ("[]") behind each command line option in the list below:

    [u]: started

    To get the TPM into the required state, call ELTT2 with the corresponding
    commands ("x" for a state means that whether this state is required or not
    depends on the actual command or the command parameters sent eventually to
    the TPM).


    Command line options:                           Preconditions:

    -a <data bytes>: Hash Sequence SHA-1            [u]

    Additional information:

    -a:
    With the "-a" command you can hash given data with the SHA-1 hash algorithm.
    This hash sequence sends 3 commands [start, update, complete] to the TPM and
    allows to hash an arbitrary amount of data.
    For example, use the following command to hash the byte sequence {0x41,
    0x62, 0x43, 0x64}:
    ./eltt2 -a 41624364

    -A:
    With the "-A" command you can hash given data with the SHA-256 hash
    algorithm. This hash sequence sends 3 commands [start, update, complete] to
    the TPM and allows to hash an arbitrary amount of data.
    For example, use the following command to hash the byte sequence {0x41,
    0x62, 0x43, 0x64}:
    ./eltt2 -A 41624364

    -b:
    With the "-b" command you can enter your own TPM command bytes and read the
    TPM response.
    For example, use the following command to send a TPM2_Startup with startup
    type CLEAR to the TPM:
    ./eltt2 -b 80010000000C000001440000

    -c:
    With the "-c" command you can read the clock values of the TPM.

    -d:
    With the "-d" command you can issue a TPM shutdown. It has 2 options:
    ./eltt2 -d
    or
    ./eltt2 -d clear    send a TPM2_Shutdown command with shutdown type CLEAR to
                        the TPM.
    ./eltt2 -d state    send a TPM2_Shutdown command with shutdown type STATE to
                        the TPM.

    -e:
    With the "-e" command you can extend bytes in the selected PCR with SHA-1.
    To do so, you have to enter the index of PCR in hexadecimal that you like to
    extend and the digest you want to extend the selected PCR with. Note that
    you can only extend PCRs with index 0 to 16 and PCR 23 and that the digest
    must have a length of 20 bytes (will be padded with 0 if necessary).
    The TPM then builds an SHA-1 hash over the PCR data in the selected PCR and
    the digest you provided and writes the result back to the selected PCR.
    For example, use the following command to extend PCR 23 (0x17) with the byte
    sequence {0x41, 0x62, 0x43, 0x64, 0x00, ... (will be filled with 0x00)}:
    ./eltt2 -e 17 41624364

    -E:
    With the "-E" command you can extend bytes in the selected PCR with SHA-256.
    To do so, you have to enter the index of PCR in hexadecimal that you like to
    extend and the digest you want to extend the selected PCR with. Note that
    you can only extend PCRs with index 0 to 16 and PCR 23 and that the digest
    must have a length of 32 bytes (will be padded with 0 if necessary).
    The TPM then builds an SHA-256 hash over the PCR data in the selected PCR
    and the digest you provided and writes the result back to the selected PCR.
    For example, use the following command to extend PCR 23 (0x17) with the byte
    sequence {0x41, 0x62, 0x43, 0x64, 0x00, ... (will be filled with 0x00)}:
    ./eltt2 -E 17 41624364

    -g:
    With the "-g" command you can read the TPM's fixed properties.

    -v:
    With the "-v" command you can read the TPM's variable properties.

    -G:
    With the "-G" command you can get a given amount of random bytes. Note that
    you can only request a maximum amount of 32 random bytes at once.
    For example, use the following command to get 20 (0x14) random bytes:
    ./eltt2 -G 14

    -r:
    With the "-r" command you can read data from a selected SHA-1 PCR.
    For example, use the following command to read data from PCR 23 (0x17):
    ./eltt2 -r 17

    -R:
    With the "-R" command you can read data from a selected SHA-256 PCR.
    For example, use the following command to read data from PCR 23 (0x17):
    ./eltt2 -R 17

    -s:
    With the "-s" command you can hash given data with the SHA-1 hash algorithm.
    This command only allows a limited amount of data to be hashed (depending on
    the TPM's maximum input buffer size).
    For example, use the following command to hash the byte sequence {0x41,
    0x62, 0x43, 0x64}:
    ./eltt2 -s 41624364

    -S:
    With the "-S" command you can hash given data with the SHA-256 hash
    algorithm. This command only allows a limited amount of data to be hashed
    (depending on the TPM input buffer size).
    For example, use the following command to hash the byte sequence {0x41,
    0x62, 0x43, 0x64}:
    ./eltt2 -S 41624364

    -t:
    With the "-t" command you can issue a TPM selftest. It has 3 options:
    ./eltt2 -t
    or
    ./eltt2 -t not_full     Perform a partial TPM2_Selftest to test previously
                            untested TPM capabilities.
    ./eltt2 -t full         Perform a full TPM2_Selftest to test all TPM
                            capabilities.
    ./eltt2 -t incremental  Perform a test of selected algorithms.

    -T:
    With the "-T" command you can read the results of a previously run selftest.

    -u:
    With the "-u" command you can issue a TPM startup command. It has 2 options:
    ./eltt2 -u
    or
    ./eltt2 -u clear    send a TPM2_Startup with startup type CLEAR to the TPM.
    ./eltt2 -u state    send a TPM2_Startup with startup type STATE to the TPM.

    -z:
    With the "-z" command you can reset a selected PCR. Note that you can only
    reset PCRs 16 and 23 and that the PCR is going to be reset in both banks
	(SHA-1 and SHA-256).
    For example, use the following command to reset PCR 23 (0x17):
    ./eltt2 -z 17


2.2 Examples:

    In order to work with the TPM, perform the following steps:
    - Send the TPM2_Startup command: ./eltt2 -u

4. Release Info

    This is version 1.1. This version is a general release.



5. FAQ and Troubleshooting

    If you encounter any error, please make sure that
    - the TPM is properly connected.
    - the TPM driver is loaded, i.e. check that "/dev/tpm0" exists. In case of
      driver loading problems (e.g. shown by "Error opening device"), reboot
      your system and try to load the driver again.
    - ELTT2 has been started with root permissions. Please note that ELTT2 needs
      root permissions for all commands.
    - the TPM is started. (See section 2.2 in this document on how to do this.)
    - Trousers do not run anymore. In some cases the Kernel starts Trousers by
      booting.
      Shut down Trousers by entering the following command:
      sudo pkill tcsd

    The following list shows the most common errors and their solution:

    The ELTT2 response is "Error opening the device.":
    - You need to load a TPM driver before you can work with ELTT2.
    - You need to start ELTT2 with root permissions.

    The ELTT2 responds with error code 0x100.
    - You need to send the TPM2_Startup command, or you did send it twice. In
      case you have not sent it yet, do so with "./eltt2 -u".

    The TPM does not change any of the permanent flags shown by sending the "-g"
    command , e.g. after a force clear.
    - The TPM requires a reset in order to change any of the permanent flags.
      Press the reset button or disconnect the TPM to do so.

    The value of a PCR does not change after sending PCR extend or reset.
    - With the application permissions you cannot modify every PCR. For more
      details, please refer to the description for the different PCR commands
      in this file.
